## Overview ##

This is a small python package that can convert the climate index metadata
information from the main spreadsheet into a set of equivalent
[yaml](https://yaml.org/) files that are better suited for automatic
processing. For more information about the metadata itself, please have a look
at the main directory of this repository or at
